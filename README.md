## Usage
Use MySQL Workbench to add the schema and seeds into a working database with the appropriate tables.

Please pay attention to the .env.sample file. You will need to create your own .env file with the same parameters and your OWN credentials to use this app.

Navigate to the correct folder in your command line. Once there, enter "node server.js" in the command line to get the app started.
